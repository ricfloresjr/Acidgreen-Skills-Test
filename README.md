The file "announcement-bar.liquid" is the new file for Announcement Bar. It is added under /sections directory.   

Shortcode  {% section "announcement-bar" %} was added above the  {% section 'header' %} in the file theme.liguid under the /layout directory.

A "Text Link" and "Text Link Color" fields were added, to control the part of the text that only has a link and also to follow the text color from the example in PDF.
